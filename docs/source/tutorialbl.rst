Tutorial: Boundary layer
=====================


Base-flow
--------

To compute the base-flow of a boundary layer, two Python programs should be modified:

#. the card (choice of geometry, physics, solver methods...): **card_bl2d_fv_npz.py**
#. the main program (choice of mesh, BC...): **BROADCAST_npz.py**

In this tutorial, we will come through each program step by step to setup a hypersonic boundary layer over an adiabatic flat plate.
